Once upon a midnight dreary as I pondered weak and weary
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore
While I nodded, nearly napping suddenly there came a tapping
As of some gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door


Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor
Eagerly I wished the morrow, vainly I had sought to borrow
From my books surcease of sorrow--sorrow for the lost Lenore

...
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels named Lenore -
Nameless here for evermore.
